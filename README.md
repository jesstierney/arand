Arand software for Blackman-Tukey Spectral Analysis
This repository contains the latest and presumably last version of the Arand spectral analysis software package, developed by Philip Howell of Brown University. I am hosting it here for posteriority reasons as to the best of my knowledge it is no longer available elsewhere. The package contains seven Java-based applets to prepare and perform spectral analysis on paleoceanographic time series. The core spectral functions, "Spectral" and "Crospec" use the Blackman-Tukey method for spectral estimation which is well-suited for identifying broad-band cycles like Milankovitch cycles (for which these functions were designed).

Please refer to the original README and Documentation .pdfs for detailed instructions on use.

The software is java-based and should run on both PCs and Macs but as this is a legacy package, I cannot guarantee compatibility. The software was recently tested on OS X 10.11.6 (El Captain) with Java 8 and it runs, although the menus on the applets are sticky and using the key commands (command + 1, etc) is more reliable.

If you use this software in a publication, please include the following reference:
